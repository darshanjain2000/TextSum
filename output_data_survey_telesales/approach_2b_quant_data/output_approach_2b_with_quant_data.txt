The overall ease of the loan application process received an average rating of 3.6, with 62% of respondents rating it in the top 2 boxes. Customers appreciated the tele-sales agents' knowledge and professionalism, with 70% and 73% of respondents respectively rating them in the top 2 boxes.

In terms of positive aspects, many customers found the loan application process to be easy and straightforward, with good support from the tele-sales agents. The clarity of the loan offers, fees, and charges, as well as the ease of setting up auto-debit and using the Home Credit mobile app, also received high ratings, with average scores of 3.7 or higher and top 2 box ratings of 65% or more.

However, the survey also identified some areas that require attention. While the majority of customers were satisfied with the clarity of the loan information, some found the details on loan offers, fees, and interest rates to be unclear, leading to confusion and dissatisfaction. Additionally, a few customers reported challenges in using the Home Credit mobile app, which impacted their overall experience.

Overall, the survey results suggest that Demo Company is providing a generally positive customer experience in its loan application process, with strong performance from the tele-sales agents and good ratings for the clarity of loan information and the ease of use of the mobile app. However, there are opportunities to improve the clarity of loan offers and to enhance the mobile app experience to ensure a consistently high level of customer satisfaction.
